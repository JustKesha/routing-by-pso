# Routing by PSO

This is my old university project that visualises routing using particle swarm optimisation.<br>
It includes a customizable editor with easy sharing features, map loading via OpenStreetMap API and supports 2 languages (English and Russian).

Website is available at https://justkesha.github.io/routing-by-pso/ thanks to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
